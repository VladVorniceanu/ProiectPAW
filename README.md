## C# Windows Forms App

This is a Windows Forms App built using C# language. It's intent is to simulate an University Admissions app.

This university admissions app was born out of a desire to address some of the common challenges faced by students and administrative staff during the admissions process. The goal was simple: to make the process more manageable for students applying to universities and for the staff handling these applications.

The app enables the user to enroll to a specific university, or manage all the students who got enrolled via the app.

Disclaimer: This is an older project that has been out of support for a while now. The project was made primarely for practicing C# and to be graded in order to succesfully complete a university class.
